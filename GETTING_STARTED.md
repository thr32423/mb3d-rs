# Getting started with mb3d-rs

mb3d-rs is a Rust port of [Mandelbulb3D](https://github.com/thargor6/mb3d)
(MB3D). It has two programs: **Mandelbulb3D**, the desktop program with
MB3D's windows, and **mb3d**, the command line renderer. They need no
installation.

## 1. Get the program

Download the archive for your system from the
[releases](../../releases) page and unpack it:

| system | archive |
|---|---|
| Windows (64 bit) | `mb3d-rs-<version>-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` |
| Linux (64 bit) | `mb3d-rs-<version>-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` |
| macOS, Apple silicon | `mb3d-rs-<version>-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` |
| macOS, Intel | `mb3d-rs-<version>-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` |

Or build it yourself with [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (stable):

```sh
git clone <this repository> mb3d-rs
cd mb3d-rs
cargo build --release          # target/release/Mandelbulb3D and target/release/mb3d
```

On macOS, a downloaded binary may need
`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine Mandelbulb3D mb3d` before the first start.

## 2. Get MB3D's formulas and maps

The release archives are laid out like a Mandelbulb3D installation, with
the whole original Mandelbulb3D repository (from
[thargor6/mb3d](https://github.com/thargor6/mb3d), see `MB3D-SOURCE.txt`):

```
Mandelbulb3D(.exe)    the program with MB3D's windows
mb3d(.exe)            the command line renderer
M3Formulas/           MB3D's formula files
M3Maps/               maps for light maps, colour maps and backgrounds
M3Parameter/          80 example parameter files
EM_JIT_M3Formulas/    more JIT formulas
History/              parameters of every "Calculate 3D" (as in MB3D)
Meshes/               meshes from BTracer2
BigRenders/           big renders
MB3D-sources/         MB3D's Delphi sources and project files
README-MB3D.md, README_1.*.txt, CHANGELOG.txt, License.txt   MB3D's documents
examples/             scenes in this port's .m3s format
```

Nothing else is needed: the program finds the formulas and maps next to
itself.

When you build mb3d yourself, get the same folders with

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thargor6/mb3d
```

(or download the repository as a ZIP from GitHub), or use an existing MB3D
installation, which has the same folders.

### Where mb3d looks for them

The easiest setup puts the folders next to the program:

```
mb3d-rs/
  Mandelbulb3D(.exe)
  mb3d(.exe)
  M3Formulas/
  M3Maps/
  M3Parameter/
```

`mb3d` searches, in this order:

| what | searched in |
|---|---|
| formulas | `--formulas DIR` (may be repeated), `$MB3D_FORMULAS` (a path list), `./M3Formulas`, `M3Formulas` next to the program |
| maps | `--maps DIR`, `$MB3D_MAPS`, `./M3Maps`, `M3Maps` next to the program, `M3Maps` next to every formula folder |

In Mandelbulb3D, *Prefs ▸ Ini dirs* sets the folders, as in MB3D; they are
kept in `Mandelbulb3D.ini` next to the program.

## 3. The Mandelbulb3D program

Start `Mandelbulb3D` (double-click it, or from a terminal, optionally with
a parameter file):

```sh
./Mandelbulb3D
./Mandelbulb3D "M3Parameter/6 AM - Torii temple.m3p"
mb3d gui "M3Parameter/6 AM - Torii temple.m3p"     # the same
```

The windows are MB3D's own (made from its form files), so MB3D's
tutorials apply. A short tour:

* **Main window:** the buttons at the top open parameters (`.m3p`,
  `.m3i`, text from the clipboard), save them and save pictures, and open
  the other windows: *Formulas*, *Lighting*, *Postprocess*, *Navigator*,
  *Animation*, *BTracer2*, *MutaGen*, *ZBuf16Bit*, *HMapGen* and the tools
  (batch, voxel export, big renders, Monte Carlo). On the right are the
  position, rotation, image size, the quality presets and *Calculate 3D*;
  below the image the mouse modes (2D zoom, X/Y, Z, get position) and the
  rotation buttons.
* **Navigator:** its own window and preview; walk with the keys (W/S,
  A/D, E/C, arrows) or the mouse (hold the right button to look around),
  then *View to main*.
* **Lighting:** changes repaint the calculated image right away; the
  presets and the palette are at the top.
* **Prefs ▸ Visual themes** switches between MB3D's Glossy look and the
  Windows look.

Every change marks the image as old; *Calculate 3D* calculates it at full
size. After that, changes in the Lighting window only repaint it and changes
of shadows or ambient occlusion only redo those, as in MB3D. *Save pic*
saves it reduced by the viewing scale (1:2 and 1:3 are anti-aliased).

## 4. The command line

```sh
mb3d "M3Parameter/6 AM - Torii temple.m3p" -o torii.png            # full size
mb3d "M3Parameter/6 AM - Torii temple.m3p" --scale 0.25 -o small.png
mb3d examples/mandelbulb.m3s -s dof=sorted -s dof_focus=0.6 -o dof.png
mb3d batch M3Parameter --scale 0.2 -o previews                       # a folder
mb3d animate flight.m3a                                              # MB3D animation
mb3d montecarlo scene.m3p --rays 64 -o mc.png
mb3d mesh scene.m3p -o object.stl
mb3d --help                     # all options; also mb3d animate --help, ...
```

Parameters copied from a forum post (`Mandelbulb3Dv18{...}`) can be saved
into a text file and opened like a `.m3p`.

## 5. When something is missing

* *formula 'xyz' not found*: the formula folder is not found; see step 2,
  or add `--formulas path/to/M3Formulas`.
* *map N not found*: the same for `M3Maps` (`--maps`).
* A file renders, but looks different from MB3D: please open an issue with
  the parameter file (README ▸ "Known differences" lists what is not ported).
