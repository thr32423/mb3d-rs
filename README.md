# mb3d-rs — Mandelbulb3D in Rust

A Rust port of [Mandelbulb3D](https://github.com/thargor6/mb3d) (MB3D, Delphi).
It renders MB3D parameter files (`.m3p`, `.m3i`, text parameters) and its own
`.m3s` scene files from the command line: built-in and custom `.m3f`
formulas (including dIFS and map formulas) in alternating hybrids or DE
combinations, inside rendering, MB3D's camera and ray marcher, colouring,
global, positional, visible and light-map lights, background pictures,
diffuse colour maps, volumetric light, ambient occlusion (15 and 24 bit SSAO,
random SSAO, DEAO), hard and soft shadows, cutting planes and depth of field.
Everything is multithreaded, big images can be rendered in tiles, and the
output is a PNG. Scenes can be written back as MB3D parameter files.
Animations are made from keyframes with MB3D's interpolation (and MB3D's
`.m3a` animation files can be opened and saved), and lists of parameter
files are rendered in batches.

**Mandelbulb3D**, the desktop program, has MB3D's windows: the main window,
Formulas, Lighting, Post processing, Navigator, Animation and all tool
windows, built from MB3D's own form files (see below).

## Building and the command line

The renderer has **no external dependencies** (std only, including its own
PNG and JPEG encoders); the windows use four crates (winit, softbuffer,
fontdue, arboard) and the graphics card two (wgpu, pollster). Everything
builds with any recent stable Rust:

```sh
cargo build --release
./target/release/mb3d --help
./target/release/mb3d -f "Amazing Box" -W 1024 -H 768 -o box.png
./target/release/mb3d examples/mandelbulb.m3s -o bulb.png --depth bulb_depth.png
./target/release/mb3d examples/hybrid_box_bulb.m3s -s iterations=40 --auto-color

# MB3D parameter files with custom formulas (.m3f from the MB3D repo):
./target/release/mb3d City.m3p --formulas path/to/mb3d/M3Formulas --scale 0.1 --aa 2 -o city.png
./target/release/mb3d -f MengerHyper --formulas path/to/mb3d/M3Formulas -o menger.png

# text parameters as posted in forums (Mandelbulb3Dv18{...}) work the same way:
./target/release/mb3d pasted.txt --formulas path/to/mb3d/M3Formulas --scale 0.1 -o pasted.png
# images (maps, background pictures) are searched in --maps DIR, $MB3D_MAPS,
# ./M3Maps, next to the executable and next to the formula directory:
./target/release/mb3d "6 AM - Torii temple.m3p" --formulas path/to/mb3d/M3Formulas --maps path/to/mb3d/M3Maps

# conversions between .m3p, .m3i, text parameters and .m3s (no rendering
# unless --render is given):
./target/release/mb3d City.m3p --save-text city.txt
./target/release/mb3d pasted.txt --save-m3p pasted.m3p
./target/release/mb3d City.m3p --save-scene city.m3s
./target/release/mb3d city.m3s -s iterations=80 --save-m3p city80.m3p

# big images in tiles (one tile after another, then stitched):
./target/release/mb3d City.m3p --formulas path/to/mb3d/M3Formulas --tiles 4x4 -o city.png
# or one tile per machine / process, written as MB3D tile parameter files:
./target/release/mb3d City.m3p --tiles 4x4 --tile 2,3 --save-m3p city_t23.m3p
./target/release/mb3d City.m3p --formulas path/to/mb3d/M3Formulas --tiles 4x4 --tile 2,3 -o t23.png
```

`--scale` shrinks the image for previews of large parameter files. The DE
stop value is in pixels, so it is scaled along with the image; the result is
like rendering at full size and downsampling. Without `--aa`, detail finer
than a pixel shows up as noise, which is why MB3D authors often render at
4000–6000 pixels and downsample.

## The Mandelbulb3D program

```sh
cargo build --release
./target/release/Mandelbulb3D [--formulas DIR] [--maps DIR] [file.m3p|.m3i|.txt]
```

`Mandelbulb3D` opens MB3D's windows as desktop windows (winit: Linux with
X11 or Wayland, Windows, macOS). The windows are made from MB3D's
original form files (`src/app/forms/*.dfm`, read at start): every control
has the position, size, caption, hint and default value it has in MB3D, and
the event handlers are ported from the Delphi units (`Mand.pas`,
`FormulaGUI.pas`, `LightAdjust.pas`, ...). A small toolkit (`src/vcl`) draws
the controls itself in MB3D's two looks: *Glossy* (MB3D's default dark
theme) and *Windows* (Prefs ▸ Visual themes). Text is drawn with the
bundled Liberation fonts; on Windows Tahoma is used if present.

The Formulas, Lighting and Post processing windows are ordinary windows
that move independently of the main window. Wayland does not let a program
place its windows, so on a Wayland desktop on Linux the program uses
X11 (XWayland) when it is available; `MB3D_WAYLAND=1` makes it use Wayland
anyway (the compositor then places the windows). A tiling compositor
places tiled windows itself; make the windows float to have MB3D's layout
(Hyprland: `windowrulev2 = float, class:^(mandelbulb3d)$`).

* **Main window:** open and save `.m3p` / `.m3i` / text parameters (and
  from or to the clipboard), save pictures (PNG, JPEG, BMP, 16 bit
  Z-buffer), the mouse modes (2D zoom, X/Y and Z moves, get position), the
  rotation buttons, image size and aspect, viewing scale, the quality
  presets, undo, *Calculate 3D* with the progressive image and the
  statistics, all pages (Calculation, Internal, Infos, Cutting, Julia Off,
  Camera, Coloring, Stereo) and the buttons to the other windows.
* **Formulas:** the six formula slots, MB3D's formula lists, options,
  hybrid types (alternate, interpolate, DE combination), favourites, `.m3f`
  loading and the **JIT formula editor** (options, constants, named params,
  Pascal code; compile and save as `.m3f`).
* **Lighting:** lights 1–6 (global, positional, light map), presets
  (built-in and custom), the palette and swatches, the Object, Ambient,
  d.Fog and Back pic pages, `.m3l` files; changes repaint the kept image
  without a new calculation. The palette editor (ColorForm) edits the
  colour positions.
* **Post processing:** normals on the z-buffer, hard and ambient shadows,
  reflections and transparency, depth of field, recalculate a selection,
  double image size (G-buffer interpolation as in MB3D).
* **Navigator:** its own window with its own parameters and preview: walk,
  look (mouse look), roll, the adjust sliders, light presets, "View to
  main" and "Send values".
* **Animation maker** with keyframe thumbnails, preview flipbook and frame
  rendering; **Batch processing** (`.m3p` lists to `.m3i` and PNG);
  **Big renders** (tiles, `.big` projects compatible with MB3D); **Monte
  Carlo** rendering (`.m3c`, batch panel); **Voxel export** (`.m3v`, with
  MB3D's stacked preview); **Bulb Tracer 2** (meshes as OBJ / PLY, preview,
  `.btrace2` settings) with the **mesh preview** window; the **HeightMap
  generator** (OBJ mesh to 8 bit PNG / 16 bit PGM height maps); **MutaGen**;
  **ZBuf16Bit**; **Map sequences**; **Ini dirs**; **Visual themes**.

The windows that draw with OpenGL in MB3D (mesh preview, HeightMap
generator) draw with a small z-buffer rasteriser using the same projection
and mouse navigation. Settings are kept in `Mandelbulb3D.ini` next to the
program, with MB3D's keys and folders (`M3Parameter`, `M3Formulas`,
`M3Maps`, `BigRenders`, ...), so a release folder looks like an MB3D
installation.

## Animation

```sh
# keyframes from parameter files, 60 sub-frames from each to the next:
./target/release/mb3d animate start.m3p middle.m3p end.m3p --frames 60 --save flight.m3k
./target/release/mb3d animate flight.m3k --list            # frame schedule
./target/release/mb3d animate flight.m3k --scale 0.25 --every 4 -o preview   # quick look
./target/release/mb3d animate flight.m3k --aa 2 -o frames --name flight      # frames/flight000001.png ...
# MB3D animation projects work too, and can be written for MB3D:
./target/release/mb3d animate project.m3a --formulas path/to/mb3d/M3Formulas -o frames
./target/release/mb3d animate flight.m3k --save flight.m3a
```

Like MB3D's animation maker, a keyframe is a complete parameter set plus the
number of sub-frames to the next keyframe. A frame takes everything from
its keyframe and puts the interpolated values on top
(`Interpolate2frames`, `Interpolate3framesBezier`):

* **interpolated:** camera (start/end plane and middle linearly, zoom and
  bailout logarithmically, the view matrix as quaternions with slerp, field
  of view), iterations, DE stop, raystep, julia values, 4D rotation (the short
  way round), cutting planes, DOF, shadow and AO lengths, the options and
  iteration counts of hybrid slots that hold the same formula in the
  keyframes (angle options the short way), and the **light values**: MB3D
  blends the derived `TLightVals`, not the sliders, and so does the port
  (colours, amounts, fog, gamma, palette, light colours, global light
  directions on the sphere, positional lights by position, picture and map
  rotations). Lights that are on in only one keyframe fade in or out.
* **interpolation:** linear, or MB3D's "quadratic bezier" (the default): a
  quadratic B-spline through the middle points between the keyframes, with
  the sub-frame position corrected for different frame counts so the speed
  stays continuous. The curve is pulled towards the keyframes but does not
  pass exactly through them. **Loop** animations continue from the last
  keyframe to the first.
* **frames:** `<folder>/<name><6 digit index>.png` like MB3D (start index and
  step, `--from`/`--to`/`--frame` select file indices). `--aa N` is MB3D's
  image scale (frames calculated N times larger and reduced). `--format bmp`,
  or `--format m3p` for one parameter file per frame (to render them
  elsewhere, e.g. with `mb3d batch`; their light settings are the blend
  interpolated on the sliders, a close approximation). `--depth` writes
  `ZBuf <name><index>.png` too.
* **continuing and sharing:** each output file is created and locked while
  its frame is calculated (MB3D's `OccupyDFile`). With `--skip-existing`,
  finished frames are kept, so an interrupted render continues where it
  stopped, and several processes (or machines on a shared folder) render
  one animation together.
* `-s key=value` changes a key in every keyframe (what MB3D's
  "process keyframes" window does).

Animation files:

* `.m3a`: MB3D's binary animation project (version 5, written by MB3D 1.7 and
  later): settings, keyframes and their preview images. Older versions
  (`TMandHeader9` keyframes) are not supported.
* `.m3k`: the text format of this port. Keyframes refer to parameter files
  (with optional changes) or hold MB3D text parameters inline:

```text
# mb3d animation
width = 1280
height = 720
scale = 2                # anti-aliasing (MB3D's image scale)
interpolation = bezier   # or linear
loop = false
output = frames          # relative to this file
name = flight
format = png             # png, bmp, m3p
start_index = 1
index_step = 1
overwrite = true
save_depth = false

[keyframe]
frames = 60
file = start.m3p
set = iterations = 40    # changes on top (repeatable)

[keyframe]
frames = 60
params = Mandelbulb3Dv18{
...
}
```

In the Mandelbulb3D program, the **Animation** window is MB3D's animation
maker: add the main window's parameters as a keyframe (or insert, replace,
delete, set frame counts), click a keyframe to load it back, preview the
frames small in the flipbook window and render them into the output folder
in the background. Animations are opened and saved as `.m3a` or `.m3k`.

## Batch rendering

```sh
./target/release/mb3d batch path/to/mb3d/M3Parameter -o renders --formulas path/to/mb3d/M3Formulas
./target/release/mb3d batch a.m3p b.m3s pasted.txt --aa 2 --skip-existing
./target/release/mb3d batch --list jobs.txt --scale 0.25 -o previews --dry-run
```

Parameter files (`.m3p`, `.m3i`, `.m3s`, text parameters; a directory means
all of them in it, and list files with one file per line, optionally followed
by changes: `6 AM - Torii temple.m3p | width = 1920 | height = 1080`) are
rendered one after another to `<name>.png` next to them or in `--output`,
like MB3D's batch window. Files that cannot be rendered are reported and the
batch goes on (the exit code tells whether all succeeded). As with
animations, outputs are locked while they are calculated: `--skip-existing`
continues an interrupted batch and lets several processes share a list.
`--format m3p` converts the files to MB3D parameter files instead.
All 80 of MB3D's example parameter files render.

## Voxel export

```sh
./target/release/mb3d voxel scene.m3p -o voxels --slices 256
./target/release/mb3d voxel scene.m3p --slices 400 --scale 1,1,0.5 --axes --iterations
./target/release/mb3d voxel scene.m3p --preview vox.png        # quick look first
./target/release/mb3d voxel project.m3v                        # MB3D voxel projects
./target/release/mb3d voxel scene.m3p --save-m3v project.m3v   # ... and back to MB3D
```

Like MB3D's voxel export, the object is cut into a stack of 1 bit PNG slices
(white = object) for voxel editors and 3D printing. The stack is a box of
2.2 / zoom scene units around the scene's middle, oriented like the view
(`--axes`: like the formula's axes), with `--slices` images of as many
pixels. A voxel is solid where the distance estimate is below the threshold
(by default from the DE stop) or, with `--iterations`, where the iteration
count reaches the maximum. In-and-outside rendering limits and MB3D's `.m3v`
projects (versions 1–4, read and written) are supported.

## Mesh export

```sh
./target/release/mb3d mesh scene.m3p -o bulb.stl
./target/release/mb3d mesh scene.m3p -o bulb.obj --resolution 300 --sharpness 2 --colors --smooth 5
./target/release/mb3d mesh scene.m3p -o part.ply --bounds 0,50,0,100,0,100 --close
```

A port of MB3D's BulbTracer2 mesh export: the distance estimate is sampled on
an N × N × N grid in a cube around the scene's middle (scale 0.5 = twice the
visible 2.2 / zoom), marching cubes with BulbTracer2's tables (including the
ambiguous cases) builds the surface where the DE is 1 / sharpness grid steps,
equal vertices are merged and the mesh is centred and scaled to size 1. OBJ
and PLY are written like MB3D's writers (with normals and optional vertex
colours from the scene's palette); binary STL, closing at the bounds and
Taubin smoothing are additions. Two planes of samples are calculated at a
time on all cores, so memory stays small at high resolutions.

## MutaGen

```sh
./target/release/mb3d mutagen scene.m3p -o muta --formulas path/to/mb3d/M3Formulas
./target/release/mb3d mutagen muta/1.2.1.m3p -o muta2 --params-strength 0.5 --seed 7
```

MB3D's MutaGen makes a family of 15 random variations: the parent's mutation
1, its children 1.1 and 1.2, four grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.
Each mutation adds, replaces or removes a formula of the hybrid (chosen from
formulas of the same kind: the DE option decides between 3D, 4D, dIFS and
ADE formulas), changes formula options, julia mode and constant, or iteration
counts, with the weights and strengths of MB3D's MutaGen window. With probing
(the default) each child is the best of up to 9 candidates rendered at
40 × 32: candidates that differ too little from their parent are dropped and
the one with the most structure (edge coverage) is kept. The output folder
gets `<label>.m3p`, a preview per member, `sheet.png` (the family in MB3D's
tree layout) and `members.txt`; the next generation starts from a chosen
member.

In the Mandelbulb3D program, the **MutaGen** window shows the tree as it
grows; a double-click on a member breeds the next generation from it, its
popup menu sends it to the main window or copies it to the clipboard, and
the arrows go back and forth between generations.

## Monte Carlo rendering

```sh
./target/release/mb3d montecarlo "Mengerplus for MC.m3p" --rays 64 -o menger.png
./target/release/mb3d montecarlo scene.m3p --time 600 --m3c scene.m3c   # stop after 10 minutes
./target/release/mb3d montecarlo scene.m3c --rays 256                   # continue later
./target/release/mb3d montecarlo bulb.m3s -s mc_reflections=true -s mc_depth=4 --exposure 150
```

A port of MB3D's Monte Carlo renderer: path tracing with the scene's lights,
palette and background. Ambient light comes from bounces between the
surfaces (`mc_depth`), lights have a size and cast soft shadows
(`mc_soft_shadow_radius`), and with `mc_reflections` the specular colours of
the palette reflect (sharp, or rough with `mc_diffuse_reflects`) up to
`mc_reflection_depth` times. With `mc_transparency` the alpha of the
specular colours (`palette_alpha`) makes surfaces transparent: refraction
(`mc_refraction_index`), Fresnel reflection, absorption coloured by the
diffuse colour (`mc_absorption`) and light scattering inside the material
(`mc_scattering`); `mc_only_difs` limits it to dIFS formulas. Depth of field
(`dof`, `dof_aperture`, `dof_focus`) uses the bokeh shapes 1..6
(`mc_bokeh`). Volumetric light, depth and dynamic fog and visible lights
work as in normal renders.

The image is refined in passes, like in MB3D's Monte Carlo window: the first
pass shoots 4 rays per pixel (Halton sampled), every further pass adds rays
where the noise estimate and the contrast to the neighbours ask for them.
`--rays`, `--passes` and `--time` say when to stop; the image (and with
`--m3c` the state, as MB3D's `.m3c` file) is written after every pass.
Exposure (`mc_exposure`, `--exposure`), colour saturation (`mc_saturation`),
HDR soft clipping (`mc_soft_clip`) and the gamma slider only change the
painting. MB3D's own `.m3c` files can be continued and the port's opened
in MB3D.

In the Mandelbulb3D program, the **Monte Carlo** window imports the main
window's parameters, renders in the background pass after pass (Start /
Stop adds rays to the image), saves the picture or `.m3c` and has MB3D's
batch panel.

## Graphics card

The main calculation (the ray marching of every pixel) runs on the
graphics card through [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs) (Vulkan, Metal, DirectX 12)
whenever the scene allows it, and on the CPU otherwise; there is nothing
to switch:

* in the program, a blinking LED right of the window title shows where the
  last calculation ran: **green** all on the graphics card, **orange**
  mixed (ray marching, shadows and ambient occlusion on the graphics
  card, normals on the z-buffer on the CPU), **red** on the CPU (also
  Monte Carlo renders), grey before the first calculation;
* `mb3d` uses it too (it prints `calculated on: ...`); `--cpu` calculates
  on the CPU only;
* the environment variable `MB3D_GPU=0` switches it off for both.

It needs the cargo feature `gpu` (part of the default build; a build with
`--no-default-features` is the CPU renderer without dependencies).

The shader (`src/gpu_march.wgsl`) is a port of the CPU's per-pixel loop
and fills the same G-buffer, then runs the hard (or soft) shadows and the
DE ambient occlusion on it (the same shader, started on the surface of
each pixel). The screen space ambient occlusion (both the 24 bit and the
older 15 bit kind) has shaders of its own (`src/gpu_ssao.wgsl`,
`src/gpu_ssao15.wgsl`) that only need the depth buffer, so it runs on the
card after a CPU calculation too; with regular sampling it gives the
CPU's values exactly, with random sampling the random numbers differ.
Reflections and the painting stay on the CPU. The marcher calculates in
single precision. The
formulas reach it through the lifter: the x86 code of an `.m3f` formula is
analysed (`src/lift.rs`: every memory access resolved to the iteration
record, the formula's constants or the stack) and translated to WGSL
(`src/lift_wgsl.rs`); the built-in *Integer Power* and *Amazing Box* are
written by hand. A scene runs on the GPU when it is an alternating 3D
hybrid of such formulas with the numerical or an analytic DE (options 0, 2
and 11). Everything else is calculated on the CPU as before: dIFS, DE
combinations, 4D and interpolation hybrids, formulas with SSE code and the
other built-in formulas, cutting planes, inside rendering, volumetric light,
views zoomed so far that single precision would show as noise (about zoom 7
at 800 pixels width), and the Monte Carlo renderer. `mb3d` prints which
was used and why; errors of the graphics card or its driver also send the
calculation to the CPU, and software renderers (llvmpipe, WARP) are not
used.

Of the 80 example parameter files of MB3D, 17 run on the GPU. On a GeForce
GTX 1650 (laptop) against a Ryzen 5 3550H (8 threads), at 640 pixels:
*TimeMachine* 1.5 s instead of 19.8 s, *Theli-At - Bone Menger* 1.4 s
instead of 11.8 s, *Hal-Tenny-Resistance* 16.5 s instead of 99 s; with
the shadows on the card too, *TreePlanet* at 400 pixels takes 0.8 s
instead of 6 s. Scenes with many iterations of strongly expanding formulas
show single precision noise (*MengerTrees*). The shadow rays differ from
MB3D in one point: MB3D stops a ray early when the neighbouring pixel found
open air at that distance; the card marches every ray to its end, so fine
structures throw slightly more shadow (a few percent of their pixels).
Developer checks: `cargo run --release --example gpuformulas -- M3Formulas`
runs every translatable formula on the GPU against the interpreter (all
278 agree), `cargo test` compares the GPU G-buffer of a Mandelbulb with
the CPU's, and `cargo run --release --example postcheck -- 320 MB3D_DIR
FILES...` compares the shadow bits and the ambient occlusion of the card
with the CPU's.

Tests check that the translated assembler matches the reference spherical
triplex formulas for all integer powers, that renders are deterministic and
independent of the thread count, that every preset renders, and that the DEs
are sane. Animation tests check the frame schedule, the interpolation (first
and last frames equal their keyframes, logarithmic zoom, slerped rotations
and light directions, fading lights, angles the short way), the file
formats and the output claiming. Phase 8 tests cut voxel slices through the
bulb, round-trip `.m3v` files, check the marching-cubes tables, that an
analytic sphere becomes a closed, round mesh with outward normals, that a
bulb mesh is found, that Aexion C matches MB3D's Pascal reference, and that
mutations, the coverage measures and a whole generation work.

## Custom formulas (`.m3f`)

MB3D's 460 formula files store their iteration step as 32-bit x86 machine
code. This port runs that code in three tiers:

1. **Translated to Rust** (`src/native.rs`, generated): 441 formulas. Their
   machine code was translated ahead of time into ordinary Rust functions,
   which the Rust compiler turns into native code for whatever CPU the crate
   is built for (x86-64, ARM64, …); nothing in it is specific to Intel CPUs.
   At run time a formula is recognised by a hash of its code bytes.
2. **Compiled micro ops** (`x86.rs`): the same analysis, executed by a small
   loop. Used for formula files that have no translation (for example new
   files added later), or with `MB3D_NO_NATIVE=1`.
3. **Interpreter** (`x86.rs`): an IA-32 emulator (integer, x87, SSE/SSE2
   subset) for code that does not fit the static model (a handful of formula files).

All tiers emulate the flat 32-bit address space with the `TIteration3Dext`
record, the option and constant buffer and a stack, using the same memory
layout and calling convention as MB3D.

The translation and the micro ops rely on the x87 register stack depth being
known at every instruction. Where code joins with different depths (for
example paths for invalid option values, or helper routines called at
different depths), the register file is rotated exactly as a different x87
TOP pointer would, so behaviour matches the CPU on every path.

Regenerating the translation (only needed when the formula set changes):

```sh
cargo run --release --bin m3f2rs -- path/to/M3Formulas -o src/native.rs
cargo build --release
```

Speed on the 2-core test machine, 120-pixel previews of the three test scenes
(volumetric light off), compared with phase 4: City 35.2 s → 4.6 s, Eagle
18.3 s → 5.4 s, Electric 28.0 s → 5.2 s. The images are pixel-identical.
Formulas with very short code (Eagle) gain less, because the cost of passing
the iteration state in and out of the emulated memory remains.

Verification: `tools/oracle/oracle.asm` is a small native 32-bit Linux
program that runs the same machine code on the real CPU from the same memory
image. `src/bin/m3fcheck.rs` compares interpreter and CPU over random inputs
for every formula:

```sh
nasm -f elf32 tools/oracle/oracle.asm -o /tmp/oracle.o && ld -m elf_i386 /tmp/oracle.o -o /tmp/mb3d_oracle
./target/release/m3fcheck path/to/M3Formulas --oracle /tmp/mb3d_oracle --trials 12
#   460 formulas: 449 ok, 0 mismatch, ...
```

All 449 testable formulas, dIFS formulas included, agree with the CPU to
1e-9 relative, in every tier (the check runs the translated code by default,
`MB3D_NO_NATIVE=1` checks the micro ops). The only differences are in the
last bits, because the x87 computes with 80-bit precision and the port uses
f64. Not checked by the oracle: the formulas compiled from Pascal source
(`[SOURCE]`, no machine code; see below) and the formulas that read image
maps through `PMapFunc` (the oracle has no maps; they work in the renderer).

Formulas written in Pascal (`[SOURCE]`, compiled by paxCompiler in MB3D) are
compiled by `jit.rs` from the Delphi subset they use; all 40 of the MB3D
repository compile, and the tests compare two of them with equivalent
formulas.

Formulas are looked up in `--formulas DIR`, `$MB3D_FORMULAS`, `./M3Formulas`
and `M3Formulas` next to the executable.

## Scene files (`.m3s`)

The INI-style format holds global keys, then optional `[formula]` sections (up
to 6, forming an alternating hybrid) and `[light]` sections (up to 6). See
`examples/`. Any key can be overridden on the command line with
`-s key=value`. `Scene::to_text()` writes the format, and `.m3p` → `.m3s` →
`.m3p` keeps every setting the port uses (checked over the parameter
collection). In `[light]` sections, `slot = N` keeps MB3D's light numbering,
`lights = none` turns all lights off, and formula options whose names are
not valid keys are written as `optionN = value ; name`.

The light values use MB3D's slider units (for example `diffuse = 50` means
1.0, `dyn_fog = 53` means off), so the binary `.m3p` light record can be mapped
onto them directly in phase 2. `color_start`/`color_end` are the colour-range
sliders (`TBpos[9]`, `TBpos[10]`). `--auto-color` fits them to the rendered
surface; this convenience is not in MB3D.

## Ambient occlusion and shadows

Like MB3D, both run on the G-buffer after the main calculation (as with the
"calculate automatically" options), and the painter then applies them.

| key | values | MB3D |
|---|---|---|
| `ao` | `off`, `ssao24` (default), `ssao24t0`, `ssao15`, `ssao15t0`, `deao` | ambient shadow, "SSAO 24 bit" / "threshold to 0" / "15 bit" / "DEAO" |
| `ao_random` | 0 = off, 1..n passes | random 24 bit SSAO with n accumulated passes |
| `deao_quality` | 0..3 (3, 7, 17, 33 rays) | DEAO quality |
| `deao_dither` | 0, 1 (2×2), 2 (3×3) | DEAO dithering |
| `deao_max_len` | default 1 | DEAO max. ray length |
| `ao_threshold` | z/r threshold, default 2 | `sAmbShadowThreshold` |
| `ao_border` | 0..0.9 | border mirror size |
| `shadows` | `off` (default), `all`, or light numbers like `1,3` | hard shadows for the selected lights |
| `shadow_soft` | `true`/`false` | "1 soft HS" (uses the last selected light) |
| `shadow_soft_radius` | 0.01..20 | soft shadow radius |
| `shadow_max_len` | default 1 | max. shadow length multiplier |
| `shadow_set_cos` | `true`/`false` | set the diffuse function of shadowed lights to cos |

```sh
./target/release/mb3d examples/mandelbulb.m3s -s shadows=1 -s shadow_soft=true -o soft.png
```

`.m3p` files bring their own settings. Shadows are only calculated when the
file has "calculate automatically" set. Hard shadows run the DE ray march
again for every pixel and light, so they cost about as much as the image
itself per light.

## Lights, volumetric light, cutting planes, depth of field

| key | values | MB3D |
|---|---|---|
| `position` (in `[light]`) | x, y, z | positional light at this world position |
| `visible` (in `[light]`) | 0 = no, 1..4 = MB3D's visible light shapes | visible light source |
| `shadow` (in `[light]`) | `true`/`false` | light uses hard shadows |
| `vol_light` | `off` or light number 1-6 | volumetric light of that light (shown with the dynamic fog colours, `dyn_fog` sets the amount) |
| `vol_light_map_size` | -7..7 | size of the light's shadow map in 20 % steps |
| `cut_x`, `cut_y`, `cut_z` | position or `off` | cutting planes; the side away from the camera is kept |
| `dof` | `off`, `sorted`, `forward` | depth of field |
| `dof_focus`, `dof_focus2` | distance as fraction of the image width | sharp range (`--stats` prints the value for the image centre) |
| `dof_aperture` | 0.0001..2 | aperture |
| `dof_max_radius` | pixels | maximum blur radius |
| `dof_passes` | 1..4 | passes |

```sh
./target/release/mb3d examples/mandelbulb.m3s -s dof=sorted -s dof_focus=0.61 -s dof_aperture=0.3 -o dof.png
./target/release/mb3d examples/mandelbulb.m3s -s cut_y=-0.2 -o cut.png
```

The volumetric light map is calculated before the image, with a ray march
per map pixel, so it adds noticeable time.

## Reflections and transparency, normals on the z-buffer

| key | values | MB3D |
|---|---|---|
| `mc_reflections` | `true`/`false` | "Calculate reflections" (post processing, and in the Monte Carlo renderer) |
| `mc_reflection_depth` | 0.. | reflections of reflections |
| `mc_reflection_amount` | 0..100 (0..1 realistic) | amount of reflected light |
| `mc_transparency` | `true`/`false` | transparency: the alpha of the palette's specular colours (`palette_alpha`) |
| `mc_only_difs` | `true`/`false` | only dIFS formulas are transparent |
| `mc_refraction_index`, `mc_absorption`, `mc_scattering` | | refraction, absorption and light scattering inside transparent material |
| `normals_on_zbuf` | `true`/`false` | "Normals on Z-buffer": normals from the positions of the neighbour pixels |

```sh
./target/release/mb3d "material colors.m3p" --formulas M3Formulas -o glass.png
./target/release/mb3d examples/mandelbulb.m3s -s cut_y=-0.6 -s mc_reflections=true -s mc_reflection_amount=0.8 -o mirror.png
```

Like in MB3D these run after the calculation: the normals on the z-buffer
before shadows and ambient occlusion, the reflections after painting (and
before the depth of field). For every object pixel the view ray is
reflected, or refracted into transparent material with Fresnel reflection,
marched to the next surface, which gets its own normal, colour, hard or
soft shadow and DE ambient occlusion and is lit like a painted pixel. The
specular colours of the palette say how much light a surface reflects.

## Hybrids, inside rendering, maps

| key | values | MB3D |
|---|---|---|
| `de_combination` | `min`, `max`, `max_inverted`, `smooth_linear`, `smooth`, `mix` | DE combination of hybrid part 1 (formulas 1..`decomb_end1`) and part 2 |
| `decomb_end1`, `decomb_start2`, `decomb_end2`, `decomb_repeat2` | formula slots 1..6 | the two parts |
| `decomb_iterations2`, `decomb_smooth`, `decomb_mix_pow`, `decomb_mix_color` | | part 2 iterations, smoothing, mix options |
| `inside` | `outside`, `inside`, `both` | inside rendering, in-and-outside |
| `background_image` | file name | background picture (sphere or `background_direct = true` image coordinates) |
| `background_rotation`, `background_brightness`, `background_add_light`, `background_ambient` | | picture rotation (bytes, 128 = half turn), brightness 1.04^(v-40), add instead of fog, small blurred copy as ambient light |
| `map`, `map_rotation` (in `[light]`) | map number, 3 bytes | light map: an image lighting from all directions |
| `diffuse_map` | map number | diffuse colour map |
| `diffuse_map_mode` | `iterations_otrap`, `normals`, `wrap_sine`, `wrap` | how the map is placed |
| `diffuse_map_offset`, `diffuse_map_rotation`, `diffuse_map_scale`, `diffuse_map_brightness_only` | | placement and "Y + colour" combination |
| `internal_gamma2` | `true`/`false` | light calculation in squared colour space |
| `ambient_relative_to_object`, `dynfog_options`, `light_mode`, `color_interpolation` | | further light options of MB3D's lighting editor |
| `tiles`, `tile`, `tile_downscale` | `4x3`, `col, row` (1-based), 1..3 | tiled rendering (also `--tiles`, `--tile`) |

Map numbers refer to the files of MB3D's `M3Maps` folder (`12.png`,
`129 name.jpg`, ...). Map formulas (height maps, map transforms) find their
images the same way. A missing image is reported and the feature is skipped.

Tiled rendering: with all tiles, the tiles are calculated one after another
into one G-buffer and SSAO, painting and DOF run on the whole image, so the
result equals an untiled render. A single tile is calculated with a border of
24 pixels for the image space effects, like MB3D's big-render tiles, and the
tile files that MB3D writes for big renders are rendered as that tile.

## Known differences and gaps

* **Coverage:** all of MB3D's rendering modes are ported (with phase 9:
  JIT formulas, interpolation hybrids, 2D slices, stereo, the reflection
  and z-buffer normal post processing and the Monte Carlo renderer), and all
  80 example parameter files render. The Mandelbulb3D program has MB3D's
  windows. Not ported: the script editor (not reachable from MB3D's main
  window either), the "shortdistance check DE" option, MB3D's random light
  strokes and the ambient light pass of the post processing window. The
  BulbTracer2 cache format (`.btr2cache`) is not written, and its OpenGL
  auto preview of the mesh is not available (the voxel preview is).
* **Monte Carlo:** the random numbers are seeded per row and pass, so an
  image is the same with any number of threads but not MB3D's; neighbour
  pixels steer the ray counts from their state at the start of a pass (MB3D
  reads them while other threads change them). The z-buffer that the Monte
  Carlo window saves with "With ZBuffer" comes from a normal calculation of
  the same parameters. MB3D's development record format (`MCoptions` bit 8)
  is not read.
* **Exports and MutaGen:** the mesh export reads but does not reproduce
  BulbTracer2's floating-point order exactly, so meshes match MB3D's in shape,
  not vertex for vertex. MutaGen uses its own random generator, so
  a seed gives other mutations than in MB3D; mutating map or light settings
  (not in MB3D's MutaGen either) is not done.
* **Animation:** `.m3a` files before version 5 are not supported. Map sequences (`Mandelbulb3DMSeq.ini` in the working folder or
  `$MB3D_MAP_SEQUENCES`) follow the file index of animation frames. Without a loop, MB3D's render loop also counts the sub-frames of
  the last keyframe (repeating it); the port renders the last keyframe once,
  as MB3D's own frame count (`TotalBMPsToRender`) and time estimate do.
  MB3D's per-frame `.m3p` files carry the keyframe's light settings
  unchanged; the port writes the interpolated sliders instead. `mb3d
  batch` writes images (or `.m3p`); the Batch processing window writes
  `.m3i` files with the G-buffer, as MB3D.
* **Speed:** custom formulas run as translated native code (including their
  SSE2 and x87 math), but still read and write their values through the
  emulated 32-bit memory, so they are slower than MB3D's hand-written
  assembler (not benchmarked against MB3D itself). Use `--scale` for previews; speed scales with the number of cores.
* **Pixel exactness:** the x87 code computed in 80-bit precision; this port
  uses f64, and f32 wherever MB3D stored values as `Single`. Images match in
  structure but are not bit-identical. The per-thread random seed of the
  "first step random" option is deterministic per row instead of using
  Delphi's `Random`. Verifying against MB3D needs reference renders made with
  the original program.
* Points exactly on the z axis are degenerate in MB3D's triplex formulas
  (division by `x² + y²`). This is kept as in the original.
